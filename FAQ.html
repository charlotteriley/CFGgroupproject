                        <h3>What do you feed pigeons?</h3>
                        <p>Pigeons will most eat seed, grains and legumes. They will sometimes eat an insect, small snail or worm in order to obtain calcium or extra protein when breeding. Unlike most birds they suck up water, gently place their beaks in water without covering the nostrils and they will drink.</p>

                         <p>Your pet pigeons needs an appropriate cage as their home base and safe place if they are living in the house. They also need safe, daily out-of-cage time in the house to exercise and socialize. An indoor pigeon shouldn't only be taken outside in a predator proof cage as they are easy targets.</p>
