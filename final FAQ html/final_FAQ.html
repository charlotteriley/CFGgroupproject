                        <p>Pigeons will most eat seed, grains and legumes. They will sometimes eat an insect, small snail or worm in order to obtain calcium or extra protein when breeding. Unlike most birds they suck up water, gently place their beaks in water without covering the nostrils and they will drink.</p>
